# M1-UFAZ_Project2

## The Main Challenge:

If you have two sentences, there are three ways they could be related: one could entail the other, one could contradict the other, or they could be unrelated. Natural Language Inferencing (NLI) is a popular NLP problem that involves determining how pairs of sentences (consisting of a premise and a hypothesis) are related.
Your task is to create an NLI model that assigns labels of 0, 1, or 2 (corresponding to entailment, neutral, and contradiction) to pairs of premises and hypotheses. To make things more interesting, the train and test set include text in fifteen different languages! You can find more details on the dataset by reviewing the Data.
Today, the most common approaches to NLI problems include using embeddings and transformers like BERT.

## Our challenge in this course:
BUT BEFORE The main challenge of using NLI as popular NLP, we are asking you a smallest challenges:

* Step 1: To prepare a simple notebook that reads the Data files in csv format and describe them. 
* Step 2: To save the data in a JSON format file, for sure the JSON will be more explicit becaus it will hold each time key:value, in the format that you can propose. 
* Step 3: To analyse the data provided by the challenge to compare the source data and to represent them explicitly before designing the AI algorithm

Here we put a pseudo solution for the project or just initial start for the project
